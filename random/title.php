            <h5>Our Story</h5>
            <p>
                MindOnMaths was found in September 2021, by a Undergradute Computer Scienctist, who had a deep
                passion for learning. Oluwasore Aladelusi, wanted to impact children of a young age and make
                learning fun by creating a website which allows for them to learn maths. Rather than being outdated
                and boring to children, a fresh, personal and fun approach was taken, to allow for each and every
                child using the website to have their own experience. We aim and continue to further update the
                website by keeping up withe the curriculum, and one day hope to be able to target other subjects.
